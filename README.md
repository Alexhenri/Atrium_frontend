# Atrium Website

This small project is a part of a potential larger project, a software that can calculate the Financial Break-Even Point for a glasses sales company, Atrium.

In this stage, we created an site html that works well with the Atrium Api, to put into practice everything that was learned during sprint 1, Basic FullStack Development, in the **FullStack Development Specialization** at PUC-Rio

In this html page you can add as many glasses as you want.
In the future the objective is to create an admin login to insert the glasses and some others infos, to calcutate the cost and the profit of this bussiness.
